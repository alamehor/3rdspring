An experimental on-line select feed items collection to pdf document converter.

Initially created for self-learning ~~web~~ technologies:
  * Ajax
  * JavaEE
  * LAM ~~P~~ (Linux, Apache, Mysql, ~~PHP~~)
  * Tomcat
  * XML
  * Microformat
  * UML
  * Design Pattern
  * TCP/IP
  * Web browser compatibility

The main idea is from how to treat my started items in my Google Reader (or maybe your favorite other feed reader). Now this project will enable you to import your favorite blog entries (or more generally, feed items) collection as OPML format and as an output you can get a pdf formated document of your collection so that you can print it, read it in one place or share with your friends by emailing it to them.
